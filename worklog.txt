thec gave me the idea for this game on our irc-channel #outbreak at ircnet.
discussed this quite a bit with thec and also did lots of thinking on my own.
emailed loosen@goatstore.com to say that I will enter this competition.
created some baseclasses and thought a bit on how to implement the whole thing.

to how the game should be :)
borrowed two controllers from my brother and got a hub from dad.
got a cube to bounce around on the screen.

zantac accepted the challange to take care of the music and sound effects. he thinks
the idea is really good and is looking forward to the finished game.
I messed around trying to play sound effects, didn't work because of spu_init in kos crashing. mailed Dan about it
multitexturing is not available I found out.
wrote a sphere generator.
multiple spheres on the screen at the same time all controllable with different controllers.
had lots of ideas for a level-generator
read up on collusion detection and got some good ideas

Apparantly the dreamcast does not clip in z.. I'll have to implement some sort of clipping for that.
Thought a lot about how levels should be created and drawed to the screen.
messed around trying to get the spu-stuff to work but still no luck :(
wrote a looooooong todo-list... jikes :)
