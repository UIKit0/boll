thec gave me the idea for this game on our irc-channel #outbreak at ircnet.
discussed this quite a bit with thec and also did lots of thinking on my own.
emailed loosen@goatstore.com to say that I will enter this competition.
created some baseclasses and thought a bit on how to implement the whole thing.
